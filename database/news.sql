(305, 'The hot jobs in tech', 'Tech’s hot in Pakistan these days no matter how one looks at it. You could substantiate that claim by using the inflow of investment in startups, which has already crossed $250 million with four months to go, but if anything, that doesn’t depict the true extent.

According to most founders, that actually is the biggest challenge for startups as they all compete for a limited talent pool amid pressures from the global marketplace since the rise of remote work.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Ensuring the retention of those resources is costly. Thanks to the Pakistan Software House Association’s recently published salary survey — based on data from 175 participating companies — we can gauge the extent of it in addition to other key trends in the tech sector labour’s market. To start with, the average monthly pay for an entry-level programmer is Rs51,344 which goes up to Rs215,723 for a senior resource (6+ years), reflecting the extent of potential growth in the field.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">But some programmers are more equal than others as entry-level MERN/MEAN/full-stack developers command the highest starting average salaries of over Rs61,000, which increase to Rs101,000 for juniors (1-3 years), Rs160,000 for middle level (3-6y), and Rs233,534 in case of seniors. Python, Ruby, Node are other leading tech stacks in terms of compensation, depending on experience. Obviously, with seniority, employees move more towards architect roles.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Other high-paying technical roles include 3D animators with an average starting level salary of Rs70,000 — the highest for any field at that stage, data miner/scientist at Rs106,765 for juniors, Rs262,500 and Rs412,500 for middle and senior-level game producers, respectively.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">According to the survey, 41pc of the participating companies reported giving out a high (30pc+) increment in 2021, an equal proportion awarded a good one (15-30pc) and 17pc handed out somewhere between 5-15pc. This is where the gap between demand and supply manifests itself as 56pc of the respondents cite a lack of skilled resources being the biggest factor in deciding higher salary. About 42pc also indicate prior experience as a key reason and 25pc mention prior/current pay.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Whether it’s because of the relatively meritocratic nature of technology where skills generally matter more than brand names/legacy or it’s something else but only 21pc companies reported giving preference to candidates from Pakistani universities and 11pc those having international certifications. Only 9pc leaned in favour of higher education or fancy foreign schools. All these seem to be in stark contrast to the apparent trends at leading multinationals. That said, graduates of major local universities do continue to lead the employee headcount, with Lahore and Islamabad attracting the most talent from Comsats, followed by Bahria and FAST-NUCES respectively. Meanwhile, public sector schools — the University of Karachi and NED — are the biggest talent pools for Karachi.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Roughly 78pc of the companies reported giving out increments to retain employees. With remote work becoming increasingly popular and attainable for an ever greater number of Pakistanis, the local tech sector is feeling some of the pinch. Approximately, 21pc respondents highlighted more than 50pc staff leaving their jobs for remote opportunities and 33pc deemed the situation alarming (10-50pc workers). It’s not surprising then that 2021 was the worst year in terms of turnover, which was 30pc, compared to 18pc in 2020. This was felt across the board by organisations of all sizes and experienced higher by entities in Karachi, at 35pc, than Lahore and Islamabad.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Another interesting area where the survey sheds light on is diversity, with regards to gender in this case. It’s no secret that tech has historically not been welcoming of women, so much so that even some of the biggest organisations such as Google have come under fire for cultivating a sexist and misogynistic culture.

But now that the MQM has weakened and the PTI’s performance in the city has been lacklustre, the party can smell blood. The victory of the party during a recent by-election was just the first step; those in the know say the party is aiming to win a considerable chunk of the city’s seats in the coming election. This is why it has made Murtaza Wahab the administrator of Karachi. It hopes the urban background of the young politician as well as his media-friendly appearance will be able to counter the party’s image as a non-doer in Karachi.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Karachi and south Punjab, it seems, is where the party has pinned its hopes to add to the total seat tally (which since 2013 has been dependent on rural Sindh), and becoming a bigger stakeholder in the coming election, be it as the leading opposition party or as a member of a coalition government at the centre. Though of course, the date is too far off to say which way the winds will blow at that time.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">The PTI too is aware of the same D-Day.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">The party is trying to roll out its signature programmes — the health card has been introduced in Punjab but the Kamyab Pakistan programme appears to have run into some hurdles. Media reports suggest the micro loan programme has been scaled back for the moment. The party has also in its trademark, haphazard manner tried to aim for Sindh, by talking big and taking on board a has-been politician whose moment of glory lay in the long-gone Musharraf era. In addition, the significance of the efforts to push ahead with electoral reforms in the face of an uncooperative — to say the least — opposition have not been lost on anyone.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Elsewhere too, sleeves are being rolled up.

For a man, who was known for his lengthy media talks as interior minister, the former (or is he?) Noonie was rather economical with his words.

But when it comes to the PML-N, the only question is about who will lead the party and what its bayania will be. There is nothing else to discuss or judge, for there are no other strategies electoral or otherwise in place. Party and politics await the family. How this will end or play out in the next two years, is anyone’s guess.

How come he manages to get the nod every now and then, while literally doing nothing spectacular, supposedly as an explosive hitter?

In the ongoing Caribbean Premier League, Asif has been an abject failure for current leaders St Kitts Nevis Patriots’ with scores of 8, 2, 4 and 18.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">And even if the laptop-obsessed chief selector — who famously unveiled his maiden Pakistan squad for the Test series against South Africa last January with a plethora of statistics to support his selections in front of a crowded media in Karachi — still considers the over-rated Asif as the ‘game-changer’ to play a pivotal part in the forthcoming World Cup.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">And just like his predecessors on the national selection committee used to do, Wasim probably overlooked the fact that Asif — the favourite of whoever that be — hadn’t played a T20 International on the UAE soil in the past three years and boasts a strike-rate of 109.72 across six matches on the slow-paced pitches of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Moreover, there are further question marks over some of the other selections — like in the case of Khushdil Shah who has been preferred to fill up one of the batting slots after the dramatic demotion of Fakhar Zaman to the ranks of reserves and the catastrophic axing of Sharjeel Khan. But the left-handed Khushdil had hardly got a proper run during the Misbah era to justify his undoubted potential as a powerful striker of the white ball.</p>', 'did-the-laptop-obsessed-chief-selector-really-do-his-homework-', 11, 33, 'image_16301116516139031809c659.56219681.jpg', 'image_16301116516139031809c659.56219681.jpg', 'image_16301116516139031809c659.56219681.jpg', NULL, 0, 1, NULL, '2021-09-08 13:38:16', '2021-09-08 13:38:16', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(362, 'How to dismantle Hindutva?', 'THERE is no reason to believe that Hindutva cannot be defeated, or dismantled, as a group of intellectuals and academics have come together to attempt. Hundreds of intellectuals from around the world with the support of scores of American universities and faculties are hoping that a three-day online huddle from Friday could set off the dismantling of right-wing Hindu groups, primarily their organisational sinews flourishing abroad.', '<p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">The intellectuals hope to canvass support in the US to help tame the insidious network of expatriate Indian groups which are linked to the ruling party in New Delhi.

Millions died in the endeavour. Even so the cancer has not been completely weeded out. In India, it would seem theoretically possible to defeat Hindutva through the electoral route that was not available to Europe.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">In spite of the heavy weather made by opposition parties to come together in the fight, Indian states have shown a canny ability to successfully challenge Hindutva’s fitful march. West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala among other regions did show not for the first time that it wasn’t terribly difficult to stall the BJP’s well-oiled election machinery. The results left Hindutva’s enormous money power and formidable street power looking not equal to the task, electorally.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Another round of crucial elections are round the corner in February next year, the main contest to watch being in the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Here a possible but never easy opposition victory could unsettle Prime Minister Modi’s game plan for a third term. A clutch of 16 other states would be holding assembly polls in the months to May 2024 when the general elections are due. Every state result counts. It’s natural to expect a tough contest from both sides, but if the opposition parties manage to strike an accord on a common strategy to shackle Modi there is no reason to believe they can’t succeed.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">An electoral victory alone, however, cannot upend the deep roots struck by Hindutva over the decades. The fascists have usurped crucial spaces in the academic and cultural spheres, and have successfully impaired the bureaucracy and other state institutions with their brazen resolve. That would not be easy to fix.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Already, even the secular rulers in Kerala have begun to coat-tail Hindutva on the religious turf. Cadres could be seen carrying idols of Hindu deities on vehicles with Che Guevara’s picture placed prominently at the back of the carrier. The intellectuals are opposing the beef ban initiated by the BJP in several states where it has its governments. There is however little appetite in the populous northern states to touch the issue where the leading opposition parties would find the prospect of tinkering with cow worship a challenge if not suicidal.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">Prospects of electoral defeat will always spur Hindutva groups to take evasive action. Their most effective tool in this area is to raise the decibels in the streets and flex raw muscle power on contrived issues. For example, the Hindutva groups have seldom been riled at being compared with European fascists. But try to say that they have similarities with the Afghan Taliban, as Javed Akhtar, the film lyricist apparently did. He has been pilloried by raw Hindutva power. And the only party that could come to his aid was the Shiv Sena. The Mumbai-based Hindu militant group flaunts at least as much raw street power as the BJP. The Shiv Sena did not agree with Akhtar’s description of the Taliban imagery to describe Hindutva, but said the Muslim writer had always stood for secularism and therefore did not deserve to be trolled.</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">The Hindutva fold is desperately looking for issues that could polarise the vote in Uttar Pradesh and other poll-bound states along Hindu-Muslim lines.

Hindutva, it said, was an authoritarian political ideology that historically drew inspiration from Nazi Germany and Mussolini’s Italy. “Its guiding principle is to transform India from a secular democracy to a religious state where Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities are relegated to second class citizenship.”</p><p style=\"border: 0px solid rgb(210, 214, 220); margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px;\">If the schedule is observed the conference is coming just ahead of a proposed visit to the US by Prime Minister Modi. Will President Biden be moved? Modi was once denied a visa to the US for the mass killing of Muslims under his watch in Gujarat in 2002. But now he is the leader of a country that’s crucial to the US strategy to encircle China. Perhaps it would have helped impair Hindutva better had the intellectuals used their persuasive skills to influence India’s opposition parties.
