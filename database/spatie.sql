These habits are as follows.\r\n\r\nLack of Omega-3 fatty acids in Diet\r\n\r\nTo avoid wrinkles in the third or fourth decade of life, it is important to include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet to keep the skin smooth and healthy. If the diet is low fat then we will be deprived of omega 3 fatty acids which will result in premature ageing.\r\n\r\nLack of Omega-3 fatty acids in Diet\r\n\r\nSleeping sideways\r\n\r\nSleeping sideways When your face is tucked into a pillow on one side which increases the risk of wrinkles on the cheeks and chin, medical experts say that lying down is the best way to sleep. Keeps the body young, fresh and calm.\r\n\r\nSleeping sideways\r\n\r\nSitting for long periods\r\nSitting too much throughout the day makes you age prematurely. It has already been proven that sitting for too long can lead to many diseases such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and even premature death. But recent research has shown that sitting for long periods of time has a negative effect on the human body.\r\nSitting for long periods\r\nExcessive sugar consumption\r\nExcessive sugar consumption increases your body weight as well as causes premature ageing. Sugar attaches to our cells and as a result, the redness disappears from the face and dark circles appear under the eyes. Similarly, wrinkles and light lines make the face look old. It’s not like you can completely eliminate sugar from your life, but avoiding sweets can help keep your face glowing.\r\n  Excessive sugar consumption\r\nLack of sleep\r\nLess sleep not only causes dark circles around the eyes but also shortens the life span. The habit of getting less than seven hours of sleep a night can lead to low energy, lethargy, difficulty concentrating or obesity throughout the day.\r\nLack of sleep\r\nMental stress\r\nNumerous research reports have shown that excessive stress can cause serious damage to body cells and accelerate the ageing process.

Due to the lockdown in different parts of the world, many people are encouraged to even do their office work from home. Many people find it difficult to concentrate on work while being at home as the work environment and home environment are totally different. Here are some tips that will help you work effectively from home if you are still not comfortable with this new routine. Continue Your Daily Routine: Just because you&rsquo;re not traveling and going to an office doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re expected to miss your regular weekday preparations. Wake up, shower, and get dressed in real clothes (not pajamas!) at your usual time. This may sound insignificant but it helps you plan mentally for the day ahead and get into the mindset of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work.&rdquo; Make A Work Space At Your Home: Though staying in bed or sitting on your sofa is relaxing, those who work successfully from home agree you &lsquo;re best off setting up a station. Choose your dining-room table if you don&rsquo;t have a seat. It allows you to maintain a healthy attitude, avoid distractions, and leave your job behind at the end of the day. Take Short Breaks: Take advantage of working from home. Take short breaks during work hours. It may seem unnecessary to take breaks, research has shown that taking short breaks can actually improve productivity and innovation. Be In Touch With Your Colleagues: If you are working in a team, make sure that you check in frequently just as you would at the workplace. Create to-do lists to keep yourself organized and focused and share the status of your lists with your supervisor. Stay Positive: This time will pass soon. Stay positive while working from home. If you will keep your mind positive, you will eventually start putting more effort into your work. You will become more dedicated to your work no matter where you are working from.</p>', '5-tips-to-work-effectively-from-home', 15, 9, 'post_main57.jpg', 'post_thumb57.jpg', 'post_list57.jpg', 2, 1, 1, 0, '2020-07-11 06:02:08', '2020-08-05 02:22:42');
